# Request Account Deletion

**Last updated:** January 13, 2026

## Introduction

At **Misticode**, we value your privacy and control over your data. In accordance with Google Play data safety policies, users of the **Fit Metrics** app have the right to request the complete deletion of their account and all associated data.

You do not need to have the app installed to request this deletion.

## How to Request Account Deletion

To permanently delete your account and data, please follow these steps:

1.  Send an email to **contacto@misticode.cl**.
2.  Use the subject line: **"Request Account Deletion - Fit Metrics"**.
3.  In the body of the email, please include the **email address** associated with your Fit Metrics account so we can verify and locate your data.

## What Happens Next?

Upon receiving your request:
1.  We will verify your identity (we may reply to confirm the request).
2.  Once confirmed, we will initiate the deletion process.
3.  This process is typically completed within **30 days**.
4.  You will receive a final confirmation email once your data has been permanently removed.

## Data That Will Be Deleted

When your account is deleted, the following data is permanently removed from our servers (Firestore and Firebase Auth):

* **Identity Data:** Your name, email address, and profile picture.
* **Health & Fitness Data:** All workout history, heart rate logs, calculated metrics (Calories, TRIMP), and session summaries.
* **Device Data:** Any registered device associations.

## Data Retention

Please note that **Fit Metrics** does not retain any user data after the account deletion process is complete. We do not keep "shadow" copies of your health data.

However, we may retain strictly necessary records of the deletion request itself (e.g., the email correspondence) for a limited time solely for legal compliance and audit purposes.
